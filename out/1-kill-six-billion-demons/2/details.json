A cold had settled in his flesh from his conception and his temperament was sometimes quite brittle, yet he was a smooth talker, an excellent patkun player, a worldly smoker, owned several fine wooden tables and a carved bone tea pot; he was fond of his smoking pipe, his sword with a hilt of white ash, and his multiversal flame manipulator was well oiled, he was not fond of talk shows, politicians or smokeless fires. He had a peculiar belief that causal reality was a particularly harsh joke, and luck could shatter with a slight finger push. For this he was widely considered the wisest of YIS\u2019 black sons.",

            "Prim was Hansa\u2019s daughter. She lived with her father in seclusion in their black house made of iron nails, where she packed his pipe and attended to his meals, tended the hearth, and swept the floor, which was constantly filled with the dust of twenty thousand universes. Her father had many visitors that stumbled often drunkenly and usually brazenly across the black threshold of his high hall, wisdom seekers and old friends, pilgrims and warriors clad in brass, those that had come to seek her father\u2019s counsel or those that had come seeking revenge. She was an average cook, and she was besides pale and spare. The skin on her knuckles was constantly raw from the harsh work of caring for her father, but there was no finer daughter, and she was a comely maid of radiant and humble visage.",
            "One day, a tall pilgrim swathed in the red of a Mendicant Knight appeared at the threshold of the black house of iron nails and inquired within. Prim, who was a well-versed daughter, attended to the stranger and brought him into her father\u2019s hall and served him with liquor and dark bread, as was the custom.",
            "\u201cStranger,\u201d said she, with a practiced modesty, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you shall wait here for longer than is tolerable. My father is abroad advising the great lords of infinity and will not return until nightfall. If you return again on the morrow, I\u2019m certain my father will receive you well.\u201d",
            "To this, the tall pilgrim gave a peculiar smile, and threw back his crimson greatcloak. Prim gave a small gasp, for there stood a shockingly handsome man, tall, golden haired, and with a strong leg, a broad shoulder, gentle eyes that radiated a fair warmth and a beautiful white smile.",
            "\u201cFair lady,\u201d spoke the Mendicant Knight, \u201cI have not come for your father. I have come for you! In my travels, I was regaled by many pilgrims of the story of the house of your esteemed father, and the rare and radiant beauty that dwelt within. At first I did not believe it, but the tales became more and more vivid, as much so that I made it my life\u2019s quest to seek you out and confirm your beauty for myself. I have taken great pains to travel here, and now I see it is more than I could have imagined!\u201d He gave a deep and sonorous laugh, and kneeling, took Prim\u2019s roughened hand in a gentle grip and kissed it softly. \u201cFairest of fairs,\u201d said he imploringly, \u201cwill you not leave your father\u2019s house and come with me?\u201d",
            "Prim was deeply moved, for she had long fantasized at leaving her father\u2019s house and making her way in the world. The beautiful stranger moved with an incredible purpose that she found thrilling and invigorating. However, her father had warned her against the company of strange men. There was no finer daughter, and her duty quickly rose up in her mind to eclipse all her golden dreams of escape. She cast her eyes downward and let out a thin sigh.",
            "\u201cAlas beautiful stranger,\u201d said she, \u201cyour words move me, but I must still sweep my father\u2019s floor, make stock of my father\u2019s house, and cook my father\u2019s dinner.\u201d",
            "The Mendicant Knight seemed perplexed, but his smile grew wider. \u201cThe tales of your dedication to your father are widely known,\u201d said he, \u201cand I had made preparations for just this!\u201d Prim was intrigued, and her heart fluttered and she sat and leaned as the stranger pulled a long, blindingly white feather from his greatcloak.",
            "\u201cBehold!\u201d the pilgrim said, \u201cA feather plucked from the Screaming Roc, the interstellar scourge of thirty worlds! After hearing of your beauty, I made great pains to assemble a company to seek about the beast and engage it in mortal combat. Ah, if only you could have seen it! The battle raged for a week and a day, and its fires scoured the stars end to end.\u201d",
            "The Mendicant Knight flashed his white smile, and with a single motion he whipped the feather across the house made of iron, and there was a great sound like the tearing of space and the hollowness of wind through an old stone, and suddenly there was a great hurricane throughout the house, which lifted every last mote of dust and grime, and decay that had been trekked through over the years, even those that Prim had missed, and carried them out the door of that great house and into the void in one rushing instant. Prim was delighted, and her heart swelled with wonder.",
            "\u201cNow will you come with me, and ride the Roc, as I did, and join me in my tender love for you?\u201d said the Mendicant Knight, stowing his feather with a flourish, and bowing deeply and mysteriously.",
            "\u201cOf course I would,\u201d said Prim plaintively, with her voice full of wonder and longing, \u201cbut I must still take account of my father\u2019s house, for his time and temper are most valuable!\u201d",
            "There was a slight flash of annoyance across the Mendicant Knight\u2019s youthful and shining face, but he snorted in defiance and laughed it away. \u201cI knew, of course, that your father was an esteemed man of accurate and some would say, miserly account.\u201d He winked.",
            "\u201cTherefore, I took great pains to travel to the Interlocking worlds and consulted with the grand artificer there, who bade me complete seven times seven tasks for him in seven times seven days, which I did, all in hope of your love. And after I completed those tasks with peerless achievement, he awarded me with this!\u201d",
            "From his greatcloak the Mendicant Knight produced a shining silver case, and when he snapped it open Prim gave an even louder gasp, for she saw it was a Quantum Perfection Engine, the likes of which were seldom seen across all the Wheel. With a hum of its silver limbs, the engine froze causal reality and counted all up states and down states and side states and thus calculated the exact quantity of everything inside the black house of iron nails before Prim could even draw a breath, blink an eyelid, or think one tenth of a thought.  In excitement, Prim leaned over the humming engine, and saw that it had counted every eyelash on her face, even the possible ones that had never existed.",
            "\u201cCome with me, dear Prim, and we will see these wonders and more. I will build you a better house, a golden one of glass and music, and even the grand artificers will be aflame with jealousy!\u201d said the Mendicant Knight, imploringly. His beautiful face was filled with genuine longing and Prim felt the radiance of love and warmth that was there. But still, the shackles of her duty to her father bound her.",
            "\u201cOh beautiful pilgrim,\u201d said she with terrible longing to escape with this beautiful man, \u201d I would, but my father\u2019s dinner still needs cooking, and without food in his stomach after his travel, I fear he will be taken dreadfully ill!\u201d",
            "\u201cAre you your father\u2019s daughter or his maidservant?\u201d said the pilgrim quite rudely, but Prim forgave him for she could see the desperation of his love, and her father had taught her to hold her judgement in all things. There was no finer daughter. \u201cForget your father\u2019s dinner! I have worlds to show you! Come and be my wife and let me languish in your radiant beauty forever!\u201d",
            "Prim was quite desperate. \u201cOh stranger, if only I could, but the needs of my father are like a black chain around my heart!\u201d said she, grasping him by the arms. His flesh was firm and steady and warm.",
            "\u201cCome with me,\u201d said he after a moment, his voice quavering, almost wheedling, and somewhat impatient, \u201cbut for an hour. There is plenty time yet to cook your father\u2019s dinner. Step outside and let me show you the stars! You are not your father\u2019s slave, forget him but for a moment and relish this time with me!\u201d His face burned with intention and he quivered with anticipation of her answer, watching her thin white lips.",
            "Prim was fearful for she seldom set foot outside her father\u2019s house, for there was no finer daughter, but the allure of the beautiful knight and the world of color and sound outside her father\u2019s dank iron house proved too much.",
            "\u201cOh, let me come!\u201d said she with an exasperated and thrilled air, and the stranger let out a mighty sigh. Donning her vela and pouch, she met the pilgrim in her hall. Before she crossed the threshold, she stopped, for she had forgotten something dear to her. \u201cLet me retrieve my greatknife,\u201d said she, surprised at her carelessness, \u201chow thoughtless of me!\u201d For her father had warned her about leaving the house, and though those iron chains around her heart still stung, there was no finer daughter.",
            "\u201cNo need!\u201d the Mendicant Knight said tersely, and then relaxed and gave a broad smile. \u201cI\u2019ll protect you.\u201d He stepped out of the threshold of Prim\u2019s iron house with a flourish, his soft and supple boots making small and beautiful sounds. Prim\u2019s heart was bursting with love and she rushed to join him, letting out a laugh like clear bells from her small, pale, and wiry body.",
            " ",
            "No sooner had Prim, daughter of Hansa, stepped out of her father\u2019s house than the Mendicant Knight\u2019s beautiful face turned ugly and he leapt upon Prim\u2019s small and frail form, laughing in his deep, sonorous voice. Prim laughed as though she would share in some kind of merriment, and then he ripped off her fine vela and tore it and let it fall on the hard earth and she instantly knew she had been fooled and his intent had been to dominate, enslave, and ravish her all along. Her father\u2019s words rang in her head and iron chains in her heart were like a lifeline she had carelessly cast aside. Hot tears sprang to her eyes as she cried out.",
            "\u201cWhat an empty girl! What a pretty, perfectly beautiful, empty headed girl!,\u201d gasped the knight, roaring with laughter with his ugly face and tearing at her clothing, breast, and sex like an animal. \u201cAs soon as I heard of you, I knew I would have to take great pains to claim that beauty for myself and no one else, and pluck you from your miserly father. Now you\u2019re mine, mine mine!\u201d howled he in triumph, his fingers ripping at her pale flesh.",
            " ",
            "The knight had forgotten, however, that Prim had sat in attendance at the tales of fifty thousand travelers, had served black bread and alcohol to more men of staggering power than the knight would see in his entire life, had learned secrets whispered around a dying hearth fire and diligently listened to her father\u2019s instructions on the secret ways of annihilation, for there was no finer daughter.",
            "Prim had been taught many ways of dismantling a man by the masters passing through her father\u2019s house and did so with a single strike in the way of Pattram Sword Hand. All the vital fluids passed from the Knight\u2019s body in a violent flash from the terrible violence Prim inflicted upon him and his body was torn apart by Universal Division and was scattered to thirty places.",
            "Prim wiped the tears from her eyes and washed her bloodstained clothes and took up her torn Vela and mended it, and she felt a little better. She buried the greatcloak of that knight and gathered the torn pieces of his body and cremated him properly, and then felt a little better. After that, she indulged in a fragant bath, and she felt a little better, and by the time she had cooked dinner, she was at peace and awaited her father and did not recount the story to him for some time.",
            "She did eventually leave that house, but only after her father died. There was no finer daughter."
